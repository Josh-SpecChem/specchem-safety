We started this project the way that we did for a specific reason. We wanted to satisfice -- in a way that only AI Agents can do -- a task coming to me from ops & HR.

So we kinda went fast and we ended up with a design language that I think wasn't so great.

Let's start over.

In my view we should always find ways to sprinkle in aspecst of navy and dark yellow because of our company's brand. But beyond that, why not use the HR tasks as a chance to experiment with style, too.

Anyway, I am sharing the SpecChem handbook. For this round let's turn it into a searchable beautiful company handbook. And let's try to do something like the style in screenshots.

I also want you to use our logo somewhere.

To complete this project you should first assume the position of an expert HR, onboarder, digital designer, and AI expert with prompt engineering prowess. You then propose the best way to structure and design the handbook, keeping in mind the need for it to be searchable and visually appealing.

And then you create a checklist for yourself to work from and you complete every step.

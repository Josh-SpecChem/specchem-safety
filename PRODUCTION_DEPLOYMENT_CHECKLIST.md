# Run migrations on production database
npm run db:migrate

# Verify database connection
npm run db:seed  # if seed data is needed
```

### **3. Git Workflow**

## üåê **Deployment Strategy**

### **Recommended: Staged Deployment**

#### **Phase 1: Staging Environment**
1. **Create staging branch from feature branch**
2. **Deploy to staging platform** (Vercel/Netlify preview)
3. **Configure staging environment variables**
4. **Test all functionality thoroughly**

#### **Phase 2: Production Deployment**
1. **Merge staging to main** (after thorough testing)
2. **Deploy to production platform**
3. **Monitor for 24 hours minimum**
4. **Document any issues and resolutions**

# Prompt 01: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL  
**Order**: 1 (Execute First)  
**Purpose**: Resolve TypeScript build failures blocking production deployment  
**Why First**: Cannot deploy to production until build succeeds

## Context

The SpecChem Safety Training Platform has multiple TypeScript compilation errors preventing successful builds. These errors are primarily in admin components and are related to hook return type mismatches and component prop incompatibilities.

## Task

Fix all TypeScript compilation errors to enable successful production builds.

## Focus Areas

1. **Admin component hook usage**
2. **API response type definitions**
3. **Component prop interfaces**
4. **Hook return type consistency**

## Success Criteria

- `npm run build` completes successfully without TypeScript errors
- All admin components compile without type errors
- Hook return types are properly typed and consistent
- Component props are correctly defined

## Required Files to Fix

### Critical Files with Errors

- `src/components/admin/AdminDashboardContent.tsx` - Hook return type issues
- `src/components/admin/CreateUserForm.tsx` - Form handler type issues
- `src/components/admin/EnrollmentManagementContent.tsx` - Multiple type issues
- `src/app/training/plant-safety-protocols/page.tsx` - Progress type issues

### Related Type Files

- `src/types/hooks.ts` - Hook return type definitions
- `src/types/api.ts` - API response types
- `src/hooks/useUnifiedAdmin.ts` - Hook implementations
- `src/hooks/useStandardizedApi.ts` - Base hook types

## Specific Issues to Resolve

1. **Hook Return Type Mismatches**
   - `useDashboardStats()` returns `UnifiedApiState<T>` but components expect `{ stats, loading, error }`
   - `useUsers()` returns `UseUsersReturn` but components expect `{ users, loading }`
   - `useEnrollments()` returns `ApiState<T>` but components expect `{ enrollments, loading }`

2. **Component Prop Type Issues**
   - `AdminTableColumn` render functions have incorrect parameter types
   - Form handlers missing proper type annotations
   - Filter state types incompatible with component props

3. **API Response Type Issues**
   - Unknown types for API responses in components
   - Missing proper type casting for dynamic data

## Expected Outcome

Application builds successfully and can be deployed to production. All TypeScript errors resolved with proper type safety maintained.

## Instructions

1. Review each file with TypeScript errors
2. Fix hook usage to match actual return types
3. Add proper type annotations for component props
4. Implement proper type casting for API responses
5. Verify build success with `npm run build`
6. Ensure type safety is maintained throughout

## Validation

```bash
# Run build to verify fixes
npm run build

# Should complete without TypeScript errors
# All components should compile successfully
```

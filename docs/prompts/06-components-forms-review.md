# Gate 6: Components & Forms Review

**Order**: 6 (Execute After Gate 5)  
**Purpose**: Verify that components and forms provide a consistent, predictable user experience  
**Why Seventh**: Broken forms and divergent validation sour the experience even if data is correct

## Context

This application uses:

- shadcn/ui component library with "new-york" style
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Comprehensive form patterns and validation
- Consistent UI patterns across the application
- Multi-tenant aware components

## Task

Verify that components and forms provide a consistent, predictable user experience.

## Focus Areas

1. **Component library consistency and standardization**
2. **Form patterns and validation consistency**
3. **UI helper utilities and shared logic**
4. **Admin flow consistency and usability**
5. **Accessibility and responsive design**
6. **Component composition and reusability**

## Success Criteria

- Single form pattern used throughout the application
- Consistent validation and error display
- Shared UI helpers eliminate code duplication
- Identical admin flows across different modules
- Proper accessibility implementation
- Responsive design consistency

## Required Files to Review

### Component Library

- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components
- `src/components/` - Custom application components
- `components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration

### Form System

- Form components in `src/components/`
- Form validation patterns
- React Hook Form integration

### UI Utilities

- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions
- UI helper components and utilities

### Design System

- `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - Design system documentation
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind configuration
- CSS and styling patterns

### Component Standards

- `docs/COMPONENT_STANDARDS.md` - Component standards
- Component documentation and examples

## What to Verify

- One form pattern and one validation/display pattern
- Shared UI helpers replace duplicated badge/format logic
- Two or three admin flows (filters → paginate → mutate) feel identical

## Expected Outcome

Predictable UX across modules.

## Instructions

Please provide a detailed analysis with specific component examples and UX consistency recommendations. Focus on identifying form validation inconsistencies, UI pattern violations, and accessibility issues that could degrade the user experience.

Purpose of Associate Handbook and Its Use

Your Team Handbook has been prepared to acquaint you more fully with
Spec Chem and personnel policies that affect you and your job. There are more practices, policies, procedures, and general information that cannot be
completely covered in this handbook. If this Handbook does not supply all the information, you need to make your questions known. You will find that we are very interested in your personal progress and will respond to your questions
with knowledge and understanding.

Spec Chem does reserve the right to interpret, amend, modify, or cancel and withdraw any or all sections or provisions of the Handbook at any time. Such
action shall become effective when a copy of an announcement is provided to associates, or upon reissue of this publication.

Additionally, the language used in this Handbook is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to constitute, a contract, nor an Employment Agreement. The contents of the Handbook are presented as a matter of information only.
While SpecChem believes wholeheartedly in the guidelines described herein, they are not conditions of employment.



Employment with SpecChem

Employment at Will
Nothing in this Team Handbook, or in any other personnel document, creates, or is intended to create a contract, promise or representation of continued
employment for any associate. SpecChem associates are subject to employment at will, which means that either the Company or associate can terminate
employment at any t ime, with or without notice and with or without cause. No supervisor or manager has any authority to enter into a contract of
employment - express or implied - with any individual.

Statement of Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment
SpecChem strives to create and maintain a work environment in which people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect. The environment of the
company should be characterized by mutual trust and the absence of
intimidation, oppression, and exploitation. SpecChem will not tolerate unlawful discrimination or harassment of any kind. Through enforcement of this policy
and by education of associates, SpecChem will seek to prevent, correct, and discipline behavior that violates this policy.

All associates, regardless of their positions, are covered by and are expected to comply with this policy and to take appropriate measures to ensure that
prohibited conduct does not occur. Appropriate disciplinary action will be
taken against any associate who violates this policy. Based on the seriousness of the offense, disciplinary action may include verbal or written reprimand,
suspension, or termination of employment.

Managers and supervisors who knowingly allow or tolerate discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, including the failure to immediately report such
misconduct to human resources ( HR), are in violation of this policy and subject to discipline.

Prohibited Conduct Under This Policy
Spec Chem, in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local anti- discrimination and harassment laws and regulations, enforces this policy in accordance with the following definitions and guidelines:



Discrimination
It is a violation of SpecChem’s policy to discriminate in the provision of
employment opportunities, benefits or privileges; to create discriminatory work conditions; or to use discriminatory evaluative standards in
employment if the basis of that discriminatory treatment is, in whole or in part, the person’s race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability
status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information or marital status.

Discrimination of this kind may also be strictly prohibited by a variety of federal, state, and local laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination Act of 1967 and the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990. This policy is intended to comply with the prohibitions stated in these anti-discrimination laws.

Discrimination in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary measures up to and including termination.

Harassment
Spec Chem prohibits harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, and will take appropriate and immediate action in response to complaints or knowledge of violations of this policy. For purposes of this policy,
harassment is any verbal or physical conduct designed to threaten,
intimidate, or coerce an associate, co-worker, or any person working for or on behalf of SpecChem.

The following examples of harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy:
Verbal harassment includes comments that are offensive or
unwelcome regarding a person’ s national origin, race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, appearance, disability,
gender identity or expression, marital status or other protected status, including epithets, slurs and negative stereotyping.
Nonverbal harassment includes distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults,
belittles or shows hostility, aversion or disrespect toward an
individual or group because of national origin, race, color, religion,

age, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, appearance, disability, sexual identity, marital status or other protected status.


Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment is a form of unlawful employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and is prohibited under SpecChem’ s anti-harassment policy. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), sexual harassment is defined as “unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature ... when ... submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions ... or such conduct has the
purpose or effect of ... creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.”

Sexual harassment occurs when unsolicited and unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature:
Is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment.
Is used as a basis for an employment decision.
Unreasonably interferes with an associate’s work performance or
creates an intimidating, hostile or otherwise offensive environment.
This definition includes many forms of offensive behavior. The following is a partial list:

Unwanted sexual advances
Offering of employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors
Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances
Visual conduct such as leering, making sexual gestures, or displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons, or posters
Verbal conduct such as making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs, sexually explicit jokes, or inappropriate comments about any
associate's body or dress
Verbal sexual advances or propositions
Verbal abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal commentary about an individual's body, sexually degrading words to describe an individual, or suggestive or obscene letters, notes, or invitations
Physical conduct such as touching, assault, or impeding or blocking movements; and

Retaliation for reporting harassment or threatening to report harassment

It is unlawful for males to sexually harass females or other males, and for
females to sexually harass males or other females. Sexual harassment on the job is unlawful whether it involves coworker harassment, harassment by a
manager, or harassment by persons doing business with or for SpecChem.

Spec Chem is committed to a work environment free of harassment and will
strictly enforce these guidelines. Harassing conduct will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination and/or other appropriate action. Any associate who believes that harassment has occurred should immediately
notify his/her supervisor.

Courteous, mutually respectful, pleasant, noncoercive interactions between associates that are appropriate in the workplace and acceptable to and
welcomed by both parties are not considered to be harassment, including sexual harassment.

Accommodations for Physical or Mental Limitations ( ADA)
The Company will make reasonable accommodations for known physical or mental disabilities in accordance with applicable law unless undue hardship to the Company would result. If you require an accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of your job, you should contact human
resources and request such an accommodation. You will be asked to specify what accommodations you need and may be required to provide a
physician’ s documentation before an accommodation can be made. Each
request will be evaluated individually in accordance with applicable law. All associates are required to comply with the company’s safety standards.
Current associates who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of
themselves or other individuals in the workplace will be placed on leave until an organizational decision has been made in regard to the associate’s
immediate employment situation.

Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company ADA policy.

Open Door Philosophy
Spec Chem encourages all associates to take an "Open Door" approach to
sharing ideas, constructive feedback, and concerns. We realize that problems often stem from lack of communication, miscommunication, and
misunderstandings. You are encouraged to bring your concerns to the

attention of your manager and attempt to resolve any issues informally. You and your manager are further encouraged to interact frequently in the
interest of developing healthy l ines of mutual communication and constructive feedback.

If you are hesitant to discuss concerns with your manager, or if you are not satisfied with measures taken by your manager, you may take your concern to human resources or Company management for further assistance.

Employment Process and Records
We’re excited you have chosen to be a part of SpecChem. You will be glad you have joined a well-managed and growing company. If you have been
looking for a place to grow professionally and personally, you’ve chosen the right company. Here, we want you to have an outstanding work experience
and career.

Employment Application
We rely on the accuracy of your application and other information
presented throughout the hiring process and employment. You may be excused from the hiring process for any misrepresentations,
falsifications, or material omissions. If you have been hired, these misleading acts can result in corrective action, up to and including termination.

Background Check and Drug Screen
Spec Chem utilizes a thorough pre-employment background check in
coordination with other pre-employment screening options. This is done to protect the Company, our associates, and our customers by employing only the “best of the best” to work at our facilities. The Pre-Employment Background Check will include a thorough criminal background check and search of the Multi-State Sex Offender Registry. Applicants with a
criminal history are not automatically disqualified from employment, they will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and an individual
assessment will be conducted.

Additionally, the Company requires a drug and possibly alcohol test by a facility of our selection and paid for by the Company in the following
circumstances:
Post- offer, pre-employment drug screen
Post-accident with or without injuries. If personal injury and/or property damage occurred, a drug and alcohol screen will follow.

Reasonable suspicion. The Company will require a drug and/ or alcohol screen if there is a reasonable suspicion that an associate’s
judgement is impaired which could compromise, not only their own safety and performance, but also that of others.

The Company also reserves the right to conduct random drug testing as it deems appropriate during your tenure with the Company.

Failure to successfully pass the test in any of the above circumstances will disqualify an applicant from employment, or for current associates, will
result in the appropriate level of discipline, up to and including
termination. In addition, a refusal to submit to such testing will be grounds for progressive discipline measures, up to and including
termination of employment.

Employment Forms
As part of the new hire process, you’ll complete the following forms:
Offer Letter, Spec Chem, LLC Acknowledgement of Obligations, W-4, State Tax form, Direct Deposit, I-9 , Code of Ethics & Associate Conduct Receipt Form, Uniform policy (if applicable), Acknowledgement & Receipt of
Handbook, Cell phone reimbursement (if applicable).

Associate Records
Spec Chem strives to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personnel information to the extent possible. As such, access to personnel files is
restricted to authorized associates, including management personnel, on a "need to know" basis only. Files are maintained in a secure area within our corporate office. Copies of documents within the personnel files will not be distributed to associates.

Associate Examination of Personnel Files: You may view your personnel records upon request to management. However,
personnel files may not leave the personnel records area; therefore, you must schedule a time to view your file with management.
Updating the Personnel File: To ensure that your personal information is up to date at all times, please notify Human
Resources of any changes including, but not limited to your name, telephone number, home address, marital status, tax information, or number of dependents.
Employment Verification: All outside requests for information regarding current or former associates, including requests for references, and

verifications of employment for any reason (i.e. loans) must be directed to human resources. Other associates are not to provide employment
references for current or prior associates to avoid having a negative
impact on both the individual giving the reference and on the company.

** Important to Note: ONLY the associate’s title and dates of employment will be verified. If the associate requesting a reference first consults
human resources or Company management to determine what
information will and will not be provided, the Company will consider providing additional information. In such an instance, the request for information must be in writing.

Benefits
Comprehensive Medical and Dental Insurance is available to qualified
full-time hourly and salaried associates, effective on the first day of the month following 30 days after the individual’s starting date.

Currently, the Company pays for a portion of family coverage and for a portion of single coverage of the monthly premium of both the
Comprehensive Medical and Dental Insurance for the individual associate and family. If an associate chooses to waive insurance initially and
decides to enroll at a later date, their application will be subject to the insurance company’ s approval.

Associates will be given a Group Insurance Benefits Booklet describing the benefits and coverage in detail.

Time Off
Paid Time Off ( PTO)
We are happy to be able to provide associates with paid time off to relax and/or address personal needs that need to occur during normal business hours.

PTO provided under this policy is accrued during an associate’ s first year of employment with Spec Chem. Once an associate reaches a full year of service in the month of January, they will be awarded a lump sum shown in the table below.





PTO Guidelines
Associates may use PTO after reaching 3 months of service.
Paid Time off is use i t or lose i t by December 31st. Only new hires
may carry over PTO within their first year of employment. After this,
PTO is awarded to all full-time associates with a minimum of 12 months of employment on January 1 each year.
If absent from work due to associate need, available PTO must be used. Leave Without Pay (LWOP) is not an option until all available forms of paid leave have been exhausted.
If absence is due to lack of work (company need), then associate may choose whether to supplement their missed t ime with PTO or take
LWOP.
SpecChem management reserves the right to change this benefit offering at any t ime with or without notice.
No pay in lieu of vacation will be made under any circumstances.
Any associate who voluntarily terminates, who is involuntarily
terminated or who is laid off by the Company will not be paid for any accrued/unused PTO.
Associates must request PTO in writing as soon as possible prior to the desired time off.
Associates can use no more than 50% of their PTO balance per quarter unless otherwise approved by their Manager.

Scheduling of Paid Time Off
Associates must request PTO in writing as soon as possible prior to the desired time off.

The Company will attempt to accommodate associate PTO requests but
reserves the right to decline a request or rearrange PTO schedules at any time because of business necessity.

If two or more associates ask to schedule PTO on the same dates, requests will be granted on the basis of seniority.


Associates will receive a 4th quarter PTO reminder each year in July. All eligible associates must request PTO for the holiday season/year end by August 31. PTO will be granted on a first come, first served basis. If two associates within the same department request the same day(s), time off will be granted based on seniority. Associates can take no more than 35% of their PTO balance in December.

Any associate who voluntarily terminates, who is involuntarily terminated or who is laid off by the Company will not be paid for any accrued/unused PTO.

**Birthday Off
Following six months of service, all associates have the option of taking a free day off to celebrate their birthday. If you are unable to take your
actual birthday off, you can select a day the week of your birthday with approval from your Supervisor. These days cannot be transferred or
accumulated. Birthdays do not count against your PTO balance.


Parental Leave
Adding a new family member is a time full of change and excitement!
Family is a big part of our culture, and we recognize that during this
important life event, bonding and being together as a family is critical.

Maternity Leave
Associates who give birth to a child will receive four weeks of paid
parental leave, which will not be deducted from your available paid time
off balance. Additional time after the four weeks should be discussed with your Supervisor for scheduling and approval.

Paternity Leave
An associate who becomes a new father will receive five days of paid parental leave without affecting their vacation time allotment.

This benefit applies to new additions to your family only and is not retroactive. Parental Leave is not paid out upon separation of
employment.

Please contact a member of Human Resources within thirty ( 30) days of the birth or adoption of your child for assistance in taking advantage of this benefit as well as adding your new child to insurance.


Holidays
It is our policy to recognize certain designated days throughout the year
as paid holidays. Holiday pay is eight regular, straight-time hours for full- time associates. Under normal conditions, the Company will observe the
following holidays:

Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
Friday After Thanksgiving
Christmas Day
New Year’ s Day

When one of the listed Holidays falls on a Saturday or Sunday the Holiday will be observed on the Friday prior, or in some cases, the Monday following. This is subject to change and CEO approval.

Holiday Eligibility
If scheduled, hourly associates must work eight hours on the first weekday preceding and eight hours on the next workday following the holiday in
order to receive holiday pay.

Regular full-time hourly and salaried associates are eligible to receive holiday pay.

Newly hired regular full-time associates are eligible to receive holiday pay upon hire.

Bereavement
Associates are allowed up to four consecutive days off from regularly scheduled duty with regular pay in the event of the death of the
associate's spouse, domestic partner, child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, father-in-law, mother, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law,
brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or an adult who stood in loco parentis to the associate during childhood.

Associates are allowed one day off from regular scheduled duty with
regular pay in the event of death of the associate’ s brother-in-law, sister- in-law, aunt, uncle, grandparent, grandchild, or spouse's grandparent.


Jury Duty
Upon receipt of notification from the state or federal courts of an
obligation to serve on a jury or to act as a court witness, the associate should notify their supervisor. The associate is required to provide
copies of the subpoena or jury summons to their supervisor and human resources.

Spec Chem will compensate you for your service as a juror, by paying you the difference between your normal wages and the amount you
receive as a juror for a maximum of five days. In order to be paid for jury duty, you must immediately submit written evidence of the time spent on jury service to human resources upon your return to work.
Written evidence of the time periods during which you have served as a juror, signed by the Jury Commissioner, a Court Clerk, or some other
authorized person, must be provided.  When you receive payment from
the Court for jury duty, please deliver the check to Human Resources for verification of payment and amount received. You will receive your jury duty pay from Spec Chem in your next regular paycheck.

Associates appearing in their own case as a plaintiff or defendant or for a non-subpoenaed court appearance will not receive paid time off.
Vacation or unpaid time should be used for such instances.

Voting
SpecChem believes that it is the responsibility and duty of associates to exercise the privilege of voting in elections. In accordance with this
philosophy, the company will grant associates approved time off to vote if necessary due to work schedules (up to 90 minutes).
All associates should be able to vote either before or after regularly assigned work hours. However, when this is not possible due to work schedules, managers are authorized to grant a reasonable period of
time, up to ninety minutes, during the workday to vote. This time off will be with pay. Time off for voting should be reported and coded
appropriately on timesheets.
Military Leave of Absence
SpecChem recognizes the responsibility of associates who are members of a military reserve organization. Such associates will be allowed
excused absences in order to fulfill their annual training obligations. Such absences will not be counted against vacation time.

A written military leave of absence request, indicating the inclusive
dates of leave, must be submitted to your supervisor as soon as you are notified of the dates of your annual obligation, and copies of the orders requiring your absence must be provided to SpecChem.

Illness
An absence of three (3) consecutive workdays because of i llness will require a doctor’s statement permitting return to work.

C. Associate Referral Program
Spec Chem is always looking for great people to add to our team. We value our associates and their opinion.

If an associate refers someone who is subsequently hired, and completes 90 days of employment, the associate will receive a bonus on their
paycheck for the following amounts:

Hourly referral = $500.00
Salary referral = $1,000.00

For an associate to qualify for the bonus, applicants must disclose the associate’s name during the interview/process on the application. Both associates must be in good standing for the bonus to be paid.

Compensation
The Company’s pay structure and job classifications have been designed with an eye toward other successful companies. Our system provides
guidelines that attempt to promote internal equity and to reward individual performance.  Your performance in your position has a
significant impact on your eligibility for merit and promotional increases.
Summarized in this section is our process for determining initial hiring salaries and the Company’s approach to determining and administering salary increases.

Your total compensation at SpecChem consists not only of the salary or
wages you are paid, but also various associate and dependent benefits as described in the “benefits” section of this Associate Handbook. Our
Company’s philosophy is to provide a total compensation package (compensation and benefits) that is competitive with successful
companies in our line of business and in our geographic area.

Compensation increases are based on merit, individual performance, and the company’s overall performance. Compensation reviews are
completed by the associate’s manager and approved by the next level manager.

Employment Classifications
Full Time. This individual regularly designated to work SpecChem’s full- time schedule of 30 hours or more and not on temporary status.

Generally, you are eligible for Spec Chem’ s benefit package subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each program.

Part Time. This is an individual regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours on a temporary status. While part- time associates receive all
legally mandated benefits (i .e. Social Security and Workers’
Compensation insurance), you are inelibible for Spec Chem’ s other benefit programs.

Non-Exempt or Exempt. This is based on the nature of the job and decided according to federal and state wage and hour laws.
Non-Exempt: Eligible to be paid overtime
Exempt: Not eligible for overtime pay

Non-Exempt Hourly Reporting
Hours Worked. It is Spec Chem’s intent to compensate associates for all hours worked. Hours worked is all time an associate “ is scheduled to
work.” Hours worked must be recorded on the associate’ s time sheet to accurately reflect total hours worked each workday.

Overtime. Hourly associates will receive overtime compensation at 1½ times their regular hourly rate for any authorized work in excess of 40 hours in one work week. Federal law states that overtime work must be accounted for in the week it is actually performed. Overtime must be assigned and approved by your manager and verified. To be
compensated, overtime is rounded to the nearest quarter hour. Only time actually worked is counted in determining eligibility for overtime compensation. Unpaid meal breaks are not counted as hours worked,
nor are hours paid for PTO, holidays, jury duty, and other forms of paid leave.

An associate may be asked to work overtime on their day off. When this situation arises, the associate will be expected to perform overtime
work, providing adequate notice is given to the associate.

Break Time. The purpose of break periods is to provide associates with a short respite from normal work activities. Break periods are
considered time worked. While break periods are usually scheduled in the middle of each four (4) hours worked, supervisors may schedule
break periods at some other time to reflect business operational needs.

Lunch Time. A meal period is provided to associates scheduled to work eight (8 ) hours or more in a day. Meal periods are not considered hours worked and therefore are not paid as long as the associate does not
work during the meal period. Although associates will be paid for all time worked, working during the meal period requires prior approval from your supervisor.

Salary Reviews and Administration

The Company supports a compensation philosophy that is competitive in our industry and which is commensurate with the responsibility of your position, your knowledge, skills and experience, and the
performance/ results achieved. The company applies these
considerations to all our associates and strives to be consistent in its salary administration practices throughout the organization.

In making salary adjustments, consideration is given to your overall job performance as well as the industry salary standard of your position.
Salary increases are based on merit. Consequently, salary increases, if given, are granted only where performance and results justify such
action.

Promotional increases are made based on the individual’ s qualifications, current salary, and sales results (where applicable). Promotions may
result in movement from one job level to another.

Hidden Benefits for All Associates
There are hidden financial benefits that serve as part of your total compensation package. In addition to your hourly/salary rate,
Spec Chem pays the employer’s share of Federal income tax. Workman’s compensation insurance, State/Federal unemployment insurance and
Group Health/Dental/Life insurance.


Associate Relations and Expectations
Business Hours
Normal business hours for the corporate office are 8:00 am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday with a one-hour lunch break unless otherwise
specified. Regular working hours at our plant locations vary by location and position.	Your manager will establish and inform you of your working
hours.


Attendance and Job Abandonment
Regular and consistent attendance is vital to SpecChem’s success and a requirement of all Associates. The company’s Associates rely on one
another to meet project and program schedules and deliverables. To ensure that we continue to	function efficiently and competitively, unscheduled
absences from work should occur only in uncontrollable circumstances such as illness or emergency.

Absenteeism, early departures from work, and late arrivals burden your
fellow co-workers and the Company. If you cannot avoid being late to work or are unable to work as scheduled, you must contact your manager via
phone call as soon as possible. An absence is defined as any absence from work during scheduled working hours ( including overtime), excluding
absence for work-incurred injuries, scheduled vacation, or time off allowed by federal or state law.

Every time you’re absent or late, or leave early, you must provide your
manager with an honest reason or explanation. You must also inform your manager of the expected duration of any absence. The Company will
comply with applicable laws relating to time off from work, but it is your responsibility to provide sufficient information to enable the Company to
make a determination. You must notify your manager of any change in your status as soon as possible.

Job Abandonment: An absence of two (2 ) consecutive
scheduled workdays or more, which has not been reported, will be considered as job abandonment, i.e. voluntary resignation
on the part of the associate. Wages will cease to be paid as of the first day of absence.
Acceptable Attendance: Acceptable attendance is defined as
having less than 4 full or partial day, unscheduled absences in a 6-month period. An unscheduled absence is defined as an
absence, not previously planned, which was taken with less
than 24 hours’ notice. Those with unacceptable attendance are
subject to disciplinary measures, up to and including termination per our progressive discipline policy.


Dress Code and Personal Appearance
Company associates are always expected to present a professional, business- like image to customers, prospects, and the public, which

specifically includes wearing Company- logo apparel in the workplace. Each associate’s dress, grooming, and personal hygiene should be appropriate to their respective work situation. Favorable personal appearance, like proper maintenance of work areas, is an ongoing requirement of employment with Spec Chem.

At its discretion, the Company may allow associates to dress in a more casual fashion than is normally required. On such occasions, associates are still
expected to present a neat appearance and avoid inappropriate clothing.

Communication
During your employment with SpecChem, you will have certain
responsibilities and obligations to our Company and the people with whom you work. Your best effort and good judgment on the job are expected.

In addition, we ask you to use common sense and intelligence in your
conduct on the job. This implies your commitment to Company expectations, such as maintaining high standards of performance and productivity, care of Company equipment, good safety, regular attendance, support of Company
Programs, good work habits, cooperation with and consideration of your
work associates, and fair representation of SpecChem in your dealings with people outside your work environment.

Two-way communication is essential to the successful operation of our
business. You are encouraged to communicate with us if a problem develops or if you want to discuss a new idea about your job.

The Company is committed to open and supportive communication between all associates daily. During a normal workday, we recognize that you may
have a question or problem concerning your job or workplace. Unless the question or problem is addressed promptly, it may become larger than it
needs to be. For this reason, you are encouraged to approach your manager informally whenever a question or problem arises, so it can be answered or corrected as quickly as possible.


Associate Complaint Procedure
The Company’s complaint procedure provides for an immediate, thorough, and objective investigation of any claim of unlawful or
prohibited harassment, appropriate disciplinary action against one found to have engaged in prohibited harassment, and appropriate remedies for any victim of harassment. A claim of harassment may exist even if the
associate has not lost a job or some economic benefit.


If you believe you have been harassed on the job, or if you are aware of the harassment of others, you should provide a written or verbal
complaint to the Owner of the Company as soon as possible. Your
complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of
individuals involved, the names of any witnesses, direct quotations when language is relevant, and any documentary evidence (notes, pictures,
cartoons, and etcetera).

Applicable law also prohibits retaliation against any associate by another associate or by the Company for using this complaint procedure or for
filing, testifying, or assisting, or participating in any manner in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by a governmental enforcement agency. Additionally, the Company will not permit any
retaliation against any associate who complains of prohibited harassment or who participates in an investigation.

All incidents of prohibited harassment that are reported will be
investigated. The Company will immediately undertake or direct an effective, thorough, and objective investigation of the harassment
allegations. The investigation will be completed and a determination
regarding the reported harassment will be made and communicated to the associate who complained and to the accused harasser( s).

If the Company determines that prohibited harassment has occurred,
management will take effective remedial action commensurate with the circumstances. Appropriate action will also be taken to deter any future harassment. If a complaint of prohibited harassment is substantiated,
appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, will be taken.

Any associate of our Company, whether a co-worker or manager, who is
found to have engaged in prohibited harassment is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge from employment. Any associate,
who engages in prohibited harassment, including any manager or
supervisor who knew about the harassment but took no action to stop it, may be held accountable and subject up to and including termination.
Managers and supervisors who knew about harassment and took no action to stop it or failed to report the harassment to their management or the Owner of the Company may also be subject to discipline up to and
including termination of employment. The Company does not consider conduct in violation of this policy to be within the course and scope of
employment or the direct consequence of the discharge of one's duties.

Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, the Company reserves the
right not to provide a defense or pay damages assessed against associates for conduct in violation of this policy.

Performance Management
Performance Management is a process that provides a means by which both the Company and its associates may attempt to remedy conflicts or concerns regarding job or behavioral performance. Corrective action is intended to be treated as an opportunity for improvement.

When an associate's performance, attendance, conduct, etc., is less than satisfactory, as determined by the Company, corrective measures may be taken to give that associate the opportunity to improve and meet
objectives. When the Company decides to utilize corrective action,
associates will be informed of unsatisfactory work performance or behavior and will be given suggestions for correcting such performance or behavior within reasonable time limits.

The Performance Management Process at SpecChem can range from informal discussions of concerns and possible solutions where less serious issues are being addressed, to formalized corrective measures with specified timelines for completion for more serious situations or in cases in which informal
discussions do not resolve the issue. Corrective action may lead to
suspension and/or termination of employment. This statement about corrective action does not alter the at-will employment relationship,
meaning that employment with the Company may be terminated at any time for any reason with or without cause or notice. Examples of some of the
types of conduct that normally lead to immediate termination of employment include, but are not limited to:

Any act of dishonesty, including theft, misappropriation of money or time.
Any act which calls into question one's integrity, such as falsification of
Company records and documents, including employment applications and timecards, competing in business with the Company, unauthorized
disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or engaging in any criminal conduct which may affect the Company and its reputation.
Any act which may create a dangerous situation, assault or otherwise
harassing another person on Company premises or disregard of property and safety standards, including possession of firearms or other weapons while on Company premises.

Any improper act or threat thereof which may be harmful to the mental, physical, or emotional well-being of another.
Improperly interfering in any way with another associate's ability to effectively perform their job duties.
The use of illegal or unauthorized substances on Company premises or
reporting to work while under the influence of the same, or otherwise in a condition not fit for work.
The use of illegal or unauthorized substances on Company premises or
reporting to work while under the influence of the same, or otherwise in a condition not fit for work.
Refusal to adhere to attendance or time keeping regulations (including excessive absenteeism or tardiness) or failure to call in or report
absences to your manager.
Using Company time, materials, or equipment for unauthorized or personal use.
Disorderly conduct or gross dereliction of duty.
Any violation of stated Company policy.

Progressive Discipline
While most associates generally perform their duties in a professional and businesslike manner, it is occasionally necessary to apply corrective
discipline due to improper behavior, unsatisfactory work performance,
absenteeism, violation of Company rules, etc. If such disciplinary action is required, the following steps will be followed. Note that skipping a step in the process may be warranted based on Associate’s actions.

Verbal Warning – When an associate fails to maintain standards or has broken a rule, a verbal warning will be given stating that repetition of this behavior may eventually call for further disciplinary action. A
note will be made of the warning and placed in associate’ s personnel file.

Written Warning – A written warning will be issued if a verbal warning does not produce the expected results. This warning will outline the
deficiencies in behavior or performance and what measures are to be taken to correct the situation. A copy of this signed written warning will be placed in an associate’s personnel file.

Final Warning – A final warning will be given if the verbal and written warnings have not produced the desired results. The warning will
describe the required change in the associate’ s behavior and attitude,

as well as what the next disciplinary step will be if the change does not materialize.

Termination – In the event that the improper behavior has not been
corrected by the preceding actions, termination will be recommended.

Immediate Termination – In cases of improper behavior such as
dishonesty, deliberate destruction of property, gross misconduct,
insubordination, excessive absenteeism, falsification of records, safety violations, etc. immediate termination may be warranted.

Performance Appraisals
Performance reviews will be conducted annually. You are encouraged to seek guidance and direction from your manager to maximize your current
performance and to develop your potential. The Company expects that you and your manager will regularly interact on an informal basis so that you
can provide your manager with feedback on how they can better assist you, and so that your manager can coach you on ways to enhance your
performance and skills.


The Company also believes it is important to formalize performance feedback on at least an annual basis. As such, associates receive regular performance
appraisals.	Our review process is designed to help you and your manager
set measures and timelines for continuing to improve performance and skills and determine a strategy for advancing the scope of your position and your career.

As a part of the review process, you will be asked to assess your
accomplishments during the period in review to ensure that any significant accomplishments are not overlooked. The associate performance appraisal process should accomplish the following objectives:

Provide you with full and accurate information concerning your performance
Identify performance elements in which you do well and those elements which require improvement
Establish plans to correct performance shortcomings
Provide a basis for linking your performance to merit increase considerations
Design a plan for training and development toward continued job growth and career enhancement


You are encouraged to comment on your appraisal and will be asked to
acknowledge it by signing the review form. Note that a positive performance review does not guarantee a raise or even continued employment. Nothing in this policy changes or limits the employment at-will relationship.

Associate Dating Policy
Spec Chem believes that a work environment where associates maintain
clear boundaries between associate personal and business interactions is necessary for effective business operations. Although this policy does not prevent the development of friendships or romantic relationships between co-workers, it does establish boundaries as to how relationships are
conducted during working hours and within the working environment.

Individuals in supervisory or managerial roles, and those with authority over others’ terms and conditions of employment, are subject to more
stringent requirements under this policy due to their status as role models, their access to sensitive information, and their ability to affect the
employment of individuals in subordinate positions. If you enter into a romantic relationship which can impact the business of Spec Chem or
employment decisions of another associate, please contact HR to review the Consensual Relationship Agreement.

Any concerns about the administration of this policy should be addressed to human resources.

Workplace Violence
Spec Chem works hard to ensure we recognize and react to situations that
could threaten the safety of our Company's associates, associates, visitors, customers, and/or property. We have created this policy in an effort to help associates identify and deal effectively with threats or acts of violence.
Acts or threats of physical violence, including intimidation, harassment
and/or coercion, which involve or affect the Company, or which occur on Company property, will not be tolerated. This prohibition against threats
and acts of violence applies to all persons involved in the operation of the Company, including, but not limited to Company personnel, contract and
temporary workers and anyone else on Company property. Violations of this policy, by any individual, will lead to disciplinary and/or legal action as
appropriate.

Workplace violence is any intentional conduct which is sufficiently severe, offensive or intimidating to cause an individual to reasonably fear for
his/her personal safety or the safety of his/her family, friends and/or

property such that employment conditions are altered or a hostile, abusive or intimidating work environment is created for one or several Company
associates.

Examples of workplace violence include, but are not limited to, the following:

Threats or acts of violence occurring on Company premises, regardless of the relationship between the Company and the parties involved in the
incident.
Threats or acts of violence occurring off Company premises involving someone who is acting in the capacity of a representative of the
Company.
Threats or acts of violence occurring off Company premises involving an associate of the Company if the threats or acts affect the business
interests of the Company.
Threats or acts of violence occurring off Company premises of which an associate of the Company is a victim if the Company determines that the incident may lead to an incident of violence on Company premises.

Threats or acts resulting in the conviction of an associate or agent of the Company, or of an individual performing service for the Company on a
contract or temporary basis, under any criminal code provisions relating to violence or threats of violence which adversely affect the legitimate
business interests of the Company.

Specific examples of conduct which may be considered threats or acts of violence under this policy, include, but are not limited to the following:

Threatening physical or aggressive contact directed toward another individual
Threatening an individual or his/her family, friends, associates, or property with harm
The intentional destruction or threat of destruction of Company property or another' s property
Harassing or threatening phone calls, letters, or emails
Surveillance
Stalking
Veiled threats of physical harm or like intimidation

Workplace violence does not refer to occasional comments of a socially acceptable nature. Such comments may include references to legitimate

sporting activities, popular entertainment or current events. Rather, it refers to behavior that is personally offensive, threatening or intimidating.

You are expected to be aware of your surroundings and to report any
suspicious behaviors or people to management, or in times of emergency
directly to the police. If an act or threat of violence occurs in your presence, stay calm and do not attempt to stop the perpetrator in any way that puts
you in a position to be harmed. Do not attempt to take a weapon away from a perpetrator or stop them through any physical means. Try to remember as many details about the incident and the perpetrator ( such as physical
appearance, dress, manner, and speech) as possible. Comply with his/her demands as best you can and only attempt to notify outsiders for help if it
would be safe to do so. In most all cases, especially those involving weapons such as guns, it will only be safe to send for help and notify the police once you are confident the perpetrator has left the premises. Do not touch
anything or disturb the scene while waiting for the police to arrive and be sure to cooperate fully with police investigations of the incident.

All incidents of violence and threats of violence that are reported will be investigated. Any person who engages in a threat or violent action on
Company property may be removed from the premises as quickly as safety permits and may be required, at the Company discretion, to remain off
Company premises pending the outcome of an investigation into the incident.

When threats are made or a Company associate commits acts of violence, a judgment will be made by the Company as to what actions are appropriate, including possible medical evaluation and/or possible disciplinary action.
Once a threat has been substantiated, it is Company’ s policy to put the threat maker on notice that he/she will be held accountable for his/her
actions and then follow through with the implementation of a decisive and appropriate response.

Under this policy, decisions may be needed to prevent a threat from being carried out, a violent act from occurring or a life-threatening situation from developing. No existing Company policy or procedure should be interpreted in a manner that prevents the above from occurring.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: The Company will make the sole determination of whether, and to what extent, threats or acts of violence will be acted upon by the
Company. In making this determination, the Company may undertake a case-by- case analysis in order to ascertain whether there is a reasonable basis to

believe that workplace violence has occurred. No provision of this policy shall alter the at-will nature of employment at SpecChem.


Open Door Policy
Spec Chem encourages all associates to take an "Open Door" approach to
sharing ideas, constructive feedback, and concerns. We realize that problems often stem from lack of communication, miscommunication, and
misunderstandings. You are encouraged to bring your concerns to the
attention of your manager and attempt to resolve any issues informally. You and your manager are further encouraged to interact frequently in the
interest of developing healthy l ines of mutual communication and constructive feedback.

If you are hesitant to discuss concerns with your manager, or if you are not
satisfied with measures taken by your manager, you may take your concern to human resources or Company management for further assistance.

Safety
It is Spec Chem’s intention to provide a safe and healthy work environment for associates. In fulfilling this obligation, Spec Chem provides modern
equipment and work facilities for your use on the job, which meet the
standards prescribed in applicable Workers’ Compensation and Occupational Safety and Health laws.

A working environment is only as safe as people make it.  SpecChem
encourages you to use good safety habits whether at home or at work.

We also encourage your participation in accident prevention. If you become aware of any unsafe working condition or a faulty piece of equipment, that my cause an injury, you must report the situation to Spec Chem as soon as
possible.


Reporting Injuries

Regardless of good intentions on the part of you or the Company, accidents do occasionally happen. If you receive any type of injury or are aware of any type of property damages on the job, inform your supervisor immediately, if possible, but in any event not later than the end of your shift. If medical
treatment is required, your supervisor must be notified before such
treatment is administered. You will be treated by a Company approved physician, unless otherwise authorized. Any time lost from your job as a

result of an industrial injury must be substantiated by attending physician. Failure to report a work-related injury may result in loss of Workers’
Compensation benefits.

Any property damaged in an accident in which the Company may in any way be involved, no matter how trivial, must be reported on the day of
occurrence in writing. Any associate having knowledge of or being a witness to any accident must also report all relevant information in writing on the
day of occurrence.

Cell Phones, Radios & Headphones
Production Associates may use cell phones during breaks in break rooms. Production Associates are not to use cell phones on the production floor.
Managers and Assistant Managers should carry their company phones at all
times. Cell phones can stay in an associate's vehicle, in the Manager’ s office, in a locker, or in the Plant’s Break Room. For emergencies, all associates will be given both managers’ numbers and the number to the plant’s office.

Music in each department is limited to one stationary AM/FM radio. Radios will maintain professional volume and content, both determined by
management’ s discretion. Additionally, headphones will not be used in any capacity on the production floor.

Social Media Policy
This policy provides guidance for associate use of social media, which should be broadly understood for purposes of this policy to include blogs, wikis,
microblogs, message boards, chat rooms, electronic newsletters, online forums, social networking sites, and other sites and services that permit users to share information with others in a contemporaneous manner.

PROCEDURES
The following principles apply to professional use of social media on behalf
of SpecChem, as well as personal use of social media when referencing
Spec Chem. **Please note that tagging yourself as an associate of SpecChem is an example of referencing the company.
Associates need to know and adhere to the SpecChem Code of Conduct,
Associate Handbook, and other company policies when using social media in reference to Spec Chem.
Associates should be aware of the effect their actions may have on their images, as well as SpecChem’s image. The information that associates
post or publish may be public information for a long time.

Associates should be aware that Spec Chem may observe content and information made available by associates through social media.
Associates should use their best judgment in posting material that is neither inappropriate nor harmful to SpecChem, its associates, or
customers.
Although not an exclusive l ist, some specific examples of prohibited
social media conduct include posting commentary, content, or images that are defamatory, pornographic, proprietary, harassing, libelous,
violent, or that can create a hostile work environment.
Associates are not to publish, post or release any information that is
considered confidential or not public. If there are questions about what is considered confidential, associates should check with the Human
Resources Department and/or supervisor. 
Social media networks, blogs and other types of online content
sometimes generate press and media attention or legal questions. Associates should refer these inquiries to authorized
Spec Chem spokespersons.
If associates encounter a situation while using social media ( with respect to SpecChem) that threatens to become antagonistic, associates should
disengage from the dialogue in a polite manner and seek the advice of a supervisor.
Associates should get appropriate permission before referring to or
posting images of current or former associates, vendors, or suppliers.
Additionally, associates should get appropriate permission to use a third party' s copyrights, copyrighted material, trademarks, service marks or
other intellectual property.
Social media use shouldn't interfere with associate’s responsibilities at Spec Chem. Spec Chem’s computer systems are to be used for business
purposes only. When using SpecChem’s computer systems, use of social media for business purposes is allowed ( ex: Facebook, Twitter, blogs and Linked In), but personal use of social media networks or personal blogging
of online content should be limited and is discouraged if it poses a distraction. Failure to use social media responsibly could result in disciplinary action.
Subject to applicable law, after-hours online activity that violates
Spec Chem’s Code of Conduct or any other company policy may subject an associate to disciplinary action or termination.
It is highly recommended that associates keep SpecChem- related social media accounts separate from personal accounts, if practical.


Separation from SpecChem
Types of Separation
Voluntary Separation - Company associates are associates “at will” and may terminate the employment relationship at any time. An associate may submit their resignation at any time. While it is preferred that the associate give two-week notice of resignation, it is not a requirement.
When notice is given, however, the Company reserves the right to
terminate employment prior to the effective date stated in the notice. Such a termination is considered as an associate-initiated termination. Procedures
Associates are requested to provide a minimum of two weeks’ notice of their intention to separate employment. The associate should / will
need to provide a written resignation notification to his or her
manager. Verification of termination will not be provided if these above two steps are not followed.
Upon receipt of an associate’ s resignation, the manager will notify the human resource ( HR) department by sending a copy of the resignation letter and any other pertinent information (e. g., associates’ reason for leaving, last day of work).
The HR department will coordinate the associate’ s departure from the company. This process will include the associate returning all company property, a review of the associates post-termination benefits status
and the employee’ s completion of an exit interview.

Involuntary Separation - As previously stated, Company associates are associates “at will” and, as such, their employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause. Employment will not be terminated for unacceptable job performance behavior, unless an associate has
been advised that his or her performance behavior is unacceptable.
The following are some examples of unacceptable performance behaviors:

Excessive absences or tardiness.
Unacceptable performance as it relates to either quantity or quality of work assigned.
Failure to follow instructions directly related to the performance of the job.
Certain situations warrant a departure from the normal procedures
listed above.  


The following are examples of acts that will result in
immediate termination (zero tolerance); please note that this list is not meant to be all-inclusive:

Falsification of, or misrepresentation in, the Employment Application or any other employment documents.
Illegal and / or criminal acts.

Other Policies

Security
It is imperative to our mutual success that we protect Company material,
products and ideas from loss. We must maintain reasonable control over the entrance to Company facilities and access to records, information, cash and other items of monetary value. Security goes beyond the scope of the
Company's Agreements with associates, business, and personal ethics. Security is an attitude of caution and discretion in handling confidential information,
whether for internal or external disclosure. The success of our Company
depends on this, and misuse or disclosure of confidential information can hurt both the associate and the Company.

Internal Communications
Associates are encouraged to check the company postings regularly in the break room and common areas for employment laws and other matters of importance.

External Communications
The Company requires associates to avoid the unauthorized disclosure of any nonpublic information acquired in the workplace. When deciding whether to disclose any information, err on the side of non-disclosure.

Quite often associates have a good sense of how the Company is performing in comparison to competitors and in comparison to our internal goals and
objectives, far before this information becomes public knowledge. The
Company believes strongly that you should be aware of the performance
standards and accomplishments of the Company, as this information will help you to better understand your role and potential contributions to the success
of our Company and your career growth. However, it is important that you
recognize the significant effect this information may have in determining the value of the Company.

Outside Employment/Conflicts of Interest
Certain outside interests and relationships may have the potential of creating a conflict of interest between you and our Company. As such, the Company must
observe guidelines pertaining to acceptable outside business or business-
related pursuits of its associates. The following, though not an exhaustive list, are examples of potentially compromising situations that may constitute a
conflict of interest and, as such, must be avoided:

Revealing confidential information to outsiders or misusing confidential information irrespective of whether for personal gain and whether harm to the Company is intended
Borrowing from or lending to associates or customers
Improperly using or disclosing to the Company any proprietary
information or trade secrets of any former or concurrent employer or other person or entity with whom obligations of confidentiality exist
Discussing prices, costs, customers, sales or markets with competing companies or their associates
Making any unlawful agreements with distributors with respect to prices
An associate taking a second job working for a competitor and sharing confidential company information with the competitor

An associate taking a second job that interferes with their ability to do their work for the company at their full potential, whether due to
scheduling, exhaustion, or some other factor
Engaging in any conduct which is not in the best interest of the Company

All Company associates, contractors and temporary personnel must take
necessary action to ensure that they do not engage in any activity that might
cause a conflict of interest. You must bring any concerns to the attention of the Owner of the Company. Violations of this standard may result in immediate
termination.

Electronic Communication Policy
Electronic communication (EC) tools provided by the Company include, but are not limited to, E-mail, voice mail, electronic forms, Internet, Intranets, and Fax. These tools are important resources that enhance our competitive advantage in the economic marketplace by improving internal and external communications with internal and external sources of information. EC is provided to Company
associates to improve communications and relationships between other associates, customers, suppliers, business partners and key professional
organizations. Furthermore, it assists in gathering information from internal
and external resources to increase knowledge, further education, and advance research for business purposes.


This Electronic Communication Usage Policy provides guidelines to assist in the effective and appropriate use of EC. In our rapidly changing technological
environment, the Company cannot address every situation for appropriateness due to information technology’ s vast complexities. The Company’s intent is for each associate to use Company assets, including EC and the access inherent for the benefit of, in the best interest of, and in a manner that does not conflict
with our Company’s policies, procedures, and business objectives. This policy
shall apply to every associate who uses EC and equivalent services through the use of any technologies or services owned or provided by the Company. This
includes, but is not l imited to: fax machines, phone lines, modems, computers, the company’s Local Area and Wide Area Networks, electronic bulletin board
providers or other commercial service providers (e.g. America Online, Prodigy, Microsoft Network, etc.). Company computers, computer networks, and other EC tools and devices are company owned resources and are subject to
monitoring by the Company and management reserves the right to not only access any EC messages, but also monitor or record them.

In using EC, associates must use integrity and professionalism in all
communications. In addition, associates must make all reasonable efforts to
protect Company information, assets and intellectual property. Personal views on controversial matters or matters affecting the Company should not be
expressed through the use of EC; to the extent that EC is used in personal
communications, care should be taken to avoid any possible implication that any view or statement contained therein is that of, or is authorized by
management. Additionally EC users should create messages as they would a hardcopy document or memo; they should not be informal or conversational. EC communications exchanged with entities and individuals outside of the
Company are not secured from outside access and monitoring.

External communications should be viewed as open to the public domain, and should not contain confidential or proprietary information about the Company its customers, associates, business objectives or interests. Associates shall
have no expectation of privacy concerning EC use.	The Company does not guarantee the privacy or integrity of any given communication. Should you
have any question regarding our EC policy, you should discuss your questions with your manager prior to engaging in any activity about which you are
uncertain. Violation of the above terms and conditions is a serious offense and may result in access of privileges being withdrawn, as well as disciplinary
actions up to and including termination of employment.

Company Cell Phones/Laptops
Mobile Devices or laptop computers owned by Specchem and used to conduct business must be used appropriately, responsible, and ethically. The following must be observed:

	Company- owned Mobile Devices are the property of Specchem and must be treated, used, and safeguarded as such. If an associate damages or

No associate is to use company-owned devices for the purpose of illegal transactions, harassment, or obscene behavior, in accordance with other existing associate policies.
Associates are prohibited from using a company-issued mobile device while operating a motor vehicle unless utilizing a hands-free device.
Further, if state or local laws are more restrictive, the associate must follow the appropriate law.

Information Sensitivity Policy

Purpose
The Information Sensitivity Policy is intended to help associates determine what information can be disclosed to non-associates, as well as the relative sensitivity of information that should not be disclosed outside of SpecChem without proper authorization.

The information covered in these guidelines includes, but is not limited to, information that is either stored or shared via any means. This includes: electronic information, information on paper, and information shared orally or visually (such as telephone and video conferencing).

All associates should familiarize themselves with the information labeling and handling guidelines that follow this introduction. It should be noted that the sensitivity level definitions were created as guidelines and to emphasize common sense steps that you can take to protect SpecChem Confidential information (e.g., SpecChem Confidential information should not be left unattended in conference rooms).

Please Note: The impact of these guidelines on daily activity should be minimal.

Questions about the proper classification of a specific piece of information should be addressed to your manager. Questions about these guidelines should be addressed to SpecChem.

Scope
All SpecChem information is categorized into two main classifications: SpecChem Public
SpecChem Confidential

SpecChem Public information is information that has been declared public knowledge by someone with the authority to do so, and can freely be given to anyone without any possible damage to SpecChem Systems, Inc.

SpecChem Confidential contains all other information. It is a continuum, in that it is understood that some information is more sensitive than other information, and should be protected in a more secure manner. Included is information that should be protected very closely, such as trade secrets, development programs, potential acquisition targets, and other information integral to the success of our company. Also included in SpecChem Confidential is information that is less critical, such as telephone directories, general corporate information, personnel information, etc., which does not require as stringent a degree of protection.

A subset of SpecChem Confidential information is "SpecChem Third Party Confidential" information. This is confidential information belonging or pertaining to another corporation which has been entrusted to SpecChem by that company under non-disclosure agreements and other contracts. Examples of this type of information include everything from joint development efforts to vendor lists, customer orders, and supplier information. Information in this category ranges from extremely sensitive to information about the fact that we've connected a supplier / vendor into SpecChem's network to support our operations.

SpecChem personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in securing SpecChem Confidential information to the proper extent. If an associate is uncertain of the sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he/she should contact their manager

Policy
The Sensitivity Guidelines below provides details on how to protect information at varying sensitivity levels. Use these guidelines as a reference only, as SpecChem Confidential information in each column may necessitate more or less stringent measures of protection depending upon the circumstances and the nature of the SpecChem Confidential information in question.

Minimal Sensitivity
General corporate information; some personnel and technical information Marking guidelines for information in hardcopy or electronic form.
Note: any of these markings may be used with the additional annotation of "3rd Party Confidential".

Marking is at the discretion of the owner or custodian of the information. If marking is desired, the words "SpecChem Confidential" may be written or designated in a conspicuous place on or in the information in question. Other labels that may be used include "SpecChem Proprietary" or similar labels at the discretion of your individual business unit or department. Even if no marking is present, SpecChem information is presumed to be "SpecChem Confidential" unless expressly determined to be SpecChem Public information by a SpecChem associate with authority to do so.

Technology Equipment Disposal Policy


Overview
Technology equipment often contains parts which cannot simply be thrown away.
Proper disposal of equipment is both environmentally responsible and often
required by law. In addition, hard drives, USB drives, CD-ROMs and other storage media contain various kinds of Spec Chem data, some of which is considered
sensitive. In order to protect our constituent’s data, all storage mediums must be properly erased before being disposed of. However, simply deleting or even
formatting data is not considered sufficient. When deleting files or formatting a device, data is marked for deletion, but is still accessible until being overwritten by a new file. Therefore, special tools must be used to securely erase data prior to equipment disposal.


Purpose
This policy has been developed to define the requirements for proper disposal of technology equipment at Spec Chem.

Scope
This policy applies to all technology equipment owned by Spec Chem.

Policy

Technology Equipment Disposal
When technology assets have reached the end of their useful li fe they should be sent to the local Information Technology office for proper disposal.

Information Technology will securely erase all storage mediums in accordance with current industry best practices.

Equipment which is working, but reached the end of its useful li fe to Spec Chem, will be made available for purchase by associates.

A lottery system will be used to determine who has the opportunity to purchase available equipment.

All equipment purchases must go through the lottery process. Associates cannot purchase their office computer directly or “reserve” a system. This ensures that all associates have an equal chance of obtaining equipment.

Finance and Information Technology will determine an appropriate cost for each item.

All purchases are final. No warranty or support will be provided with any equipment sold.

Any equipment not in working order or remaining from the lottery process will be donated or disposed of according to current environmental guidelines. Information Technology has contracted with several organizations to donate or properly dispose of outdated technology assets.

Prior to leaving Spec Chem premises, all equipment must be removed from the Information Technology inventory system.

SpecChem Ramifications
Failure to properly dispose of technology equipment can have several negative ramifications to the Spec Chem including f ines, negative customer perception and costs to notify constituents of data loss or inadvertent disclosure.

Enforcement
Any associate found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Acceptable Use Policy

Overview
Spec Chem’s intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose
restrictions that are contrary to Spec Chem’s established culture of openness, trust and integrity. Spec Chem is committed to protecting Spec Chem's associates,
partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not l imited to computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts
providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the property of Spec Chem.
These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the
interests of the company, and of our clients and customers in the course of
normal operations. Please review Human Resources policies for further details.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every Spec Chem associate and affiliate who deals with information and/or
information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities accordingly.


Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at Spec Chem. These rules are in place to protect the associate and Spec Chem.
Inappropriate use exposes Spec Chem to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.

Scope
This policy applies to associates, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at Spec Chem, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This
policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by Spec Chem.


Policy

General Use and Ownership
While Spec Chem's network administration desires to provide a reasonable level of privacy, users should be aware that the data they create on the corporate systems remains the property of Spec Chem. Because of the need to protect Spec Chem's
network, management cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information stored on any network device belonging to Spec Chem.
Associates are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use. Individual departments are responsible for

creating guidelines concerning personal use of Internet/Intranet/ Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, associates should be guided by departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty, associates should consult their supervisor or manager.

Spec Chem recommends that any information that users consider sensitive or vulnerable be encrypted.

For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within Spec Chem may monitor equipment, systems, and network traffic at any time.
Spec Chem reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy.

kept at the facility where work is performed.

The shirts may be a variety of long and short-sleeved versions but will total no more than eleven ( 11 ) units combined. The pants may also be a variety of long pants and
shorts but will total no more than eleven ( 11 ) units combined. Plant Managers will inform associates of any plant- specific requirements.

Eligible associates will be allowed two ( 2 ) jackets which, during the summer months, will be turned in during periods of non- use. The site plant managers will coordinate this effort with the associates and their local driver representative.

## 📦 UN-Rated Packaging

### What is UN-Rated Packaging?

UN ratings for packaging were developed to make transporting hazardous materials both **safer** and **easier**. If a material is DOT-regulated, it must be kept in UN-rated packaging for both storage and transport.

### Key Features

- **Multi-faceted Rating System** - Signified by letters and numbers permanently marked on containers
- **Rigorous Testing** - Containers undergo series of tests to demonstrate conformity to standards
- **DOT Enforcement** - U.S. Department of Transportation enforces these regulations

### Testing Standards

UN-rated containers are tested to ensure they can withstand:

| Test Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pressure Changes** | External pressure variations without failing |
| **Internal Pressure** | Conditions of internal pressure buildup |
| **Weight Bearing** | Extended weight loads at high temperatures |
| **Vibration** | Transport-related vibrations |
| **Drop Testing** | Freefall drops that may occur during transport |

### When UN-Rated Packaging is Required

UN-rated packaging is **mandatory** for materials classified as:

- 💥 Explosives
- 🌬️ Non-flammable gas
- 🔥 Flammable gas
- 🔥 Flammable liquid
- 🦠 Infectious substance
- ⚠️ Corrosive material
- 🔥 Flammable solid
- 💨 Oxidizer
- 🧪 Organic peroxide
- ☠️ Toxic materials
- ☢️ Radioactive materials

### SpecChem Common Materials

At SpecChem, the materials requiring UN-rated packaging are primarily:
- **Flammable liquids** (most common)
- **Corrosives** 
- **Toxic materials**
- **Oxidizers** (occasional)

> ⚠️ **Critical Rule**: It is **never acceptable** to substitute non-UN-rated packaging when working with hazardous materials. **No exceptions.**

### Responsibility and Compliance

**DOT Responsibility**: Ensuring compliance with handling and transport regulations
**Shipper Responsibility**: Ensuring operations are compliant, including:
- ✅ Authorized packaging usage
- ✅ Proper manufacturing standards
- ✅ Proper assembly procedures
- ✅ Proper marking requirements

**Failure to comply can be costly** - both corporately and individually.

## 🔍 Identifying DOT-Regulated Materials

### Three Primary Information Sources

#### 1. Safety Data Sheet (SDS) - Section 14
- **Purpose**: Identifies if material is DOT-regulated
- **Contains**: Required marking/labeling elements
- **Limitation**: Shows regulation status but not specific packaging type

#### 2. Production Order
- **Purpose**: Verification of packaging requirements
- **Contains**: Basic description and specific container type (e.g., "blue steel UN pail")
- **Access**: Request to view from supervisor
- **Limitation**: Not used as primary production floor document

#### 3. Excel Files on Server
- **Location**: Desktop shortcuts link to packaging folders
- **Files**: Separate files for pails and drums
- **Contains**: 
  - Package type for all products
  - UN-rating indicators
  - **Proper closing instructions**
- **Backup**: Source documents with manufacturer's closing instructions

### Example: CureNSeal 25EX

**SDS Section 14**: Identifies as DOT-regulated per 49 CFR 172.01
**Excel File Results**:
- **Pails**: UN-rated blue steel pails + closing instructions
- **Drums**: UN-rated blue steel drums + proper drum wrench specifications

## 🏷️ Package Marking Requirements

### The I-SHIP System

Remember proper marking with the acronym **I-SHIP**:

| Letter | Component | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **I** | **Identification Number** | UN number identifying specific material/category |
| **S** | **Proper Shipping Name** | Describes hazard properties and composition |
| **H** | **Hazard Class** | Nine subdivisions describing hazard type |
| **I** | **Packing Group** | Danger level indicator (lower number = higher danger) |
| **P** | **Package** | Container specifications |

### Example: CureNSeal 25EX Basic Description
- **Identification Number**: UN 1139
- **Proper Shipping Name**: Coating solution
- **Hazard Class**: 3
- **Packing Group**: 2

### Required Stickers and Labels

#### DOT Hazard Stickers
- **Format**: Square stickers using GHS pictograms
- **Common Types at SpecChem**:
  - Class 3: Flammable liquid sticker
  - Class 8: Corrosive sticker
- **Source**: Pre-printed on continuous rolls

#### UN Labels
- **Purpose**: Mark packaging with I-SHIP information
- **Location**: Corporate server in same folder as product labels
- **Size Requirements**:
  - **Pails**: UN ID minimum 6mm (0.24 inches)
  - **Drums/Totes**: UN ID minimum 12mm (0.47 inches)
- **Organization**: Separate folders for drums, pails, and totes
- **Printing**: 12 per sheet (most common), 10 per sheet, or 6 per sheet

#### Sticker Sheet Specifications
- **12 per sheet**: ULINE S5627 or Avery equivalent

## 🔒 Proper Closure Procedures

Proper closure is **vital** for preventing leaks and ensuring compliance. These procedures apply to all packaging containers, DOT-regulated or not.

### 🥁 Drum Closure

#### Types of Drums and Required Torque

| Drum Type | Bung Size | Material | Required Torque |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Steel drums | 2-inch | Steel bung | **30 foot-pounds** |
| Steel drums | 3/4-inch | Steel bung | **15 foot-pounds** |
| Steel drums | 2-inch | Poly bung | **20 foot-pounds** |
| Steel drums | 3/4-inch | Poly bung | **9 foot-pounds** |
| Poly drums | 2-inch | Poly bung | **20 foot-pounds** |

#### Required Tools: Calibrated Torque Wrenches

##### Red Handle Drum Wrench (Steel Bungs)
- **Large 4-lug side**: 30 foot-pounds (2-inch steel bungs)
- **Single lug side**: 15 foot-pounds (3/4-inch steel bungs)

##### Yellow Handle Drum Wrench (Poly Bungs)  
- **Large 4-lug side**: 20 foot-pounds (2-inch poly bungs)
- **Single lug side**: 9 foot-pounds (3/4-inch poly bungs)

#### Wrench Features
- **Handle labeling**: Shows calibrated torque values, owning plant/department, bung material
- **Function**: When proper torque is reached, bung tool stops rotating while handle bends
- **Exclusivity**: **Only these tools may be used** for HAZ material drums - no exceptions

### 🪣 Pail Closure

#### Three-Step Process
1. **Place Lid**: Position uncrimped lid on pail
   - If spouted lid: Orient spout opposite product label to prevent label damage
2. **Align Crimper**: Place crimper over lid
   - Align 16 lugs on crimper with 16 tabs on lid
3. **Crimp**: Press down on crimper handles
   - Apply firm, even pressure until handles reach end of motion
   - Proper alignment ensures secure crimping across entire tab length

> ⚠️ **Alignment Critical**: Lugs set over tab gaps result in incomplete crimping and potential leakage

### 🏺 Tote Closure

#### Torque Requirements
- **Most Common**: Mauser-manufactured totes require **70 foot-pounds**
- **Verification**: Check closing instructions folder via desktop shortcut
- **Path**: S: → Operations → Compliance → Closing Instructions → "IBC Closing Instructions totes.pdf"
- **Unknown Manufacturer**: Contact plant manager for purchasing guidance

#### Required Tools
1. **IBC/Tote Wrench**: Internally slotted circular ring with handles and square center hole
2. **Socket Torque Wrench**: Standard 1½ inch drive

#### Four-Step Process
1. **Position**: Place tote wrench over lid
2. **Set Torque**: Dial socket wrench to desired torque (usually 70 foot-pounds)
3. **Insert**: Place socket head into square hole of tote wrench frame  
4. **Tighten**: Turn socket wrench until handle breaks/bends without turning head
